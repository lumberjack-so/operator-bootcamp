      question: "I'm not technicalâ€”will I drown?",
      answer: "Nope. Drowning requires deep water; we start you in the kiddie pool and raise the floor each week. By Week 3 you'll brag about your Git commits."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I miss a live call?",
      answer: "Catch the 4K replay, skim the timestamped notes, drop questions in Slackâ€”done. Life happens, automation waits."
    },
    {
      question: "Time-zone issues?",
      answer: "We alternate 9 AM ET / 4 PM ET so both hemispheres stay sane. Worst case: watch the replay over breakfast."
    },
    {
      question: "How much homework are we talking?",
      answer: "About one Netflix episode per weekâ€”except you end with workflows, not cliff-hangers."
    },
    {
      question: "I already know n8n basicsâ€”too easy for me?",
      answer: "Great! You'll sprint through Weeks 1-3 and feast on advanced agent architecture, Claude Desktop tricks and monetisation modules."
    },
    {
      question: "Corporate card readyâ€”can you invoice?",
      answer: "Yes. VAT-friendly invoices, PO numbers, carrier pigeonsâ€”whatever your finance team needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm still not satisfied?",
      answer: "Take the first two weeks. If you're not automating real stuff by then, email us for a 100% refund. No awkward forms, no \"break-up\" call."
    },
    {
      question: "Software requirements?",
      answer: "Free n8n Desktop/self-host, a GitHub account, Zoom, optional Cursor or VS Code. If your laptop runs Chrome, you're good."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I lose access after 90 days?",
      answer: "Never. Recordings, templates and Slack stay openâ€”automation is a lifelong sport."
    }
